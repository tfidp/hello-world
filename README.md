Creation of a mobile application and website of a international digital political party

Creation of a mobile application and website of a political party with the following sections:

1. News feed (local / general)
2. Forum (local / general)
3. Messages (personal / groups)
4. Banking (multicurrency wallet)

5. Basic settings


NEWS
The news feed is formed from news messages of all users and includes a headline, media file and news text +/- medium size.
Comments are allowed to all participants and moderated by moderators. Have a score rating and a discussion rating.
Ranked by time and date by default. But getting a big response, they go up in the feed (or not - you should think over the algorithm).
News that receive a large number of discussions are automatically duplicated in the Forum.
There must be multilingual support with auto-translation in both directions.

DISCUSSION FORUM
involves questions and answers, discussion of current topics and news. Includes theme, media, and extended text.
Any registered person can participate.
Topics that receive a large number of discussions automatically appear in the News Feed under the Important Discussions category.
Multilingual support with auto-translation in both directions. 

MESSAGES
Essentially a multilingual messenger for private messages and group chats. With accelerated listening. With support for attached files of all required formats.
Audio and video messages and online calls should also be available. It is desirable to implement the function of forwarding, forwarding and redirecting to news / forums.
Hopefully there will be encryption of any data transmission. 

BANKING
A multi-currency wallet supporting all major currencies, including cryptocurrencies. With the ability to carry out all transfers and payments, including with NFC.
Has storage pockets for various purposes. An advisor for smart distribution of funds. Possibility of requests for loans, credits and the like.
If possible, more cashbacks, interest on the balance and rewards for donations.

Site / application rules (including privacy terms, data use and everything needed)
App and Ribbon Language (Preferred / Multi)
